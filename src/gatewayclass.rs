// GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
// Gateway resources.
//
// It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
// means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
// was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
// propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
// limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
// If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
// Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.
//
// Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations MUST
// add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
// associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
// Gateway is not deleted while in use.
//
// GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.
